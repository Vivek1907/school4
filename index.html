       <p>Sree Cauvery School at Indiranagar stands both as a symbol of integrity and also as a tribute to the Kodavas as an enlightened community with an immense love and respect for education.<br><br>

            Let us retrace our path. The pioneering steps taken by great luminaries like the former Chief Minister of Karnataka, Late Sri. R. Gundu Rao , Late Lt. Col. Koothanda M. Chengappa and many hands seen and unseen toiled to build this institution to what it stands today.<br><br>

            From a humble beginning with forty students in 1982, today 37 years later the mammoth structure replete with laboratories and an auditorium houses 1439 students.<br><br>

            The school is managed under the guidance of the Kodava Samaja Education Council.<br><br>

            Sree Cauvery School holds its pride in flaunting its excellence in the field of academics, sports, co-curricular activities and state of art technology in classrooms.<br><br>

            The level of academic success achieved by our students in all classes is good, particularly so at the Board level examinations ie, always 100% results or results tending towards it. Today we have established ourselves as a Bench Mark Institution of Learning.</p>
